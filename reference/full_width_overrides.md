**\[experimental\]** This is an experimental function that will likely
be removed in future releases, as we work through updating the core
package styling and adding full width options into the components

issues when combined with components from other packages, use at your
own risk.

## Usage

full_width_overrides()
```

HTML containing CSS styling overrides

## Examples

shinyGovstyle::full_width_overrides()
